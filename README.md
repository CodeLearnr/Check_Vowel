# Check_Vowel
Write a program that asks the user to enter a lowercase letter and determines whether or not the letter is a vowel. If the user enters a vowel, print "This is a vowel", if the user enters a consonant, print "This is a consonant". If the user enters the letter 'y', print "This is sometimes a vowel". If the user enters anything other than a lowercase letter, print "Invalid input".
